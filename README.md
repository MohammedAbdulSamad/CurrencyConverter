# CurrencyConverter
A Simple Java Program that Converts Currency Entered
- Only 5 different Currencies at the moment
- As there are only 5, I implemented the currency rates for different countries with ArrayList but i do understand that with more currencies this implementation will need to be changed to a more appropriate data structure.

Some Screenshots of the Program:
